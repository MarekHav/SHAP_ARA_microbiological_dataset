## Feature Importance Analysis on Microbiological Data
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook created during my work on a research project focused on feature importance methods applied to microbiological data.

During the project, I explored and compared ARA and SHAP methods as approaches for explaining black-box prediction models.

##About this repository

The attached notebook reflects my research workflow, including experimentation, exploration, and intermediate analyses.

The main goal of this repository is to document individual parts of the research process — from exploratory data analysis to graphical visualizations that can be used to present and interpret the results.
